## 👋 Hi, I’m Muskan — Software Engineer | Data & UX | Building Inclusive Tech

I'm a Software Engineer at the intersection of **large-scale systems** and **human-centered design**. I build distributed data pipelines and AI-assisted tools, while advocating for inclusive & equitable tech. I’m actively exploring new opportunities in **Data Engineering, Full-Stack Engineering, or UX Research**.  

🌟 What Makes Me Unique  

- **Technical + Human-Centered:** I bridge the gap between software engineering & UX research --> designing systems not only scalable but also human-focused.
- **Impact at Scale:** Experienced in building TB-scale data pipelines + distributed ETL systems that power intelligent AI.  
- **Socially Driven:** Passionate about mental health, LGBTQIA+ advocacy, & projects that combine technical skill with social good.  
- **Collaborative & Curious:** Comfortable leading technical design, mentoring teammates, & conducting user studies to inform product decisions.  

💻 Key Projects  

- **[Flyway](https://github.com/gmuskan95/visa-eligibility-analyzer)** – AI Immigration Eligibility Analyzer  
  Full-stack Flask app using Claude API to analyze multi-visa eligibility; built an AI resume parser, reducing manual entry by 80%.  

- **[PromptShield](https://github.com/gmuskan95/PromptShield)** – Privacy-Focused AI Prompt Protection  
  Browser extension that detects and redacts PII (emails, phone numbers, SSNs, API keys, IPs, etc.) before prompts are sent to AI chat services; built with TypeScript, Chrome APIs, and real-time regex-based detection.

- **🌱 Trail Steward** – Outdoor Recreation Platform  
  Currently working on 0-to-1 MVP connecting hikers and trail managers; designed geospatial queries & API surfaces (TypeScript, Firebase). *Proprietary project, not publicly available.*

- **[RealSeal](https://github.com/AnnhScribner/HackForImpact)** – AI Image Detection Tool (Hack4Impact 1st place)  
  Fine-tuned CV Transformer for AI-generated image detection; built Python/Flask inference API for real-time predictions.  

🛠️ Technical Skills  

**Languages:** Python, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Java  
**Data & Backend:** Spark, Airflow, Databricks, Microservices, REST APIs, ETL/ELT, NoSQL  
**AI/ML:** LLM APIs, prompt engineering, model evaluation  
**Cloud & Tools:** AWS, Docker, Git, CI/CD, Jupyter, Grafana  

🎓 Education  

- **M.S. Computer Science**, Virginia Tech — Thesis: Social computing & mental health, ACM CSCW 2025  
- **B.Tech Computer Science**, Manipal Institute of Technology
